Deployment Steps for Web Scraping Application

1. Deploy RabbitMQ with Helm:

Use Helm to deploy RabbitMQ in the default namespace of your Kubernetes cluster.
Store RabbitMQ credentials (username, password, host) in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Secret Manager for secure management.
2. Deploy Web Scraper:

Deploy the web scraper in the default namespace.
Create a GCP service account key with permissions to access Secret Manager. This service account will be used by the web scraper to fetch RabbitMQ credentials.
Store the service account key in a ConfigMap and mount it into the web scraper pod for authentication purposes.
3. Obtain External URL for Web Scraper:

Retrieve the external IP address of the web scraper and store it in Secret Manager.
Associate this secret with Cloud Run to establish communication between Cloud Run and the web scraper.
4. Integrate with Elastic Cloud:

Deploy Elasticsearch on Elastic Cloud and obtain the app search URI and key.
Store these credentials in Secret Manager for secure management.
Testing:

Input a website URL into the web scraper for testing purposes.
Monitor RabbitMQ for information related to the scraping process.
Check logs in Elastic Cloud for both RabbitMQ startup and web scraping activities.
